TASK DESCRIOTON : 

The main goal of this task was to build and visualize a Decision Tree model using the scikit-learn library in Python. Decision Trees are one of the most powerful and easy-to-understand machine learning algorithms used for both classification and prediction problems. The idea behind this task is to understand how a Decision Tree splits data based on feature importance, visualize the structure of the tree, and analyze its prediction performance using a chosen dataset.

Tools and Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries Used:
o	pandas – for data loading and preprocessing
o	numpy – for numerical operations
o	scikit-learn (sklearn) – to build, train, and evaluate the Decision Tree model
o	matplotlib & seaborn – for visualization of the decision tree and data
•	Editor/Platform: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
•	Dataset Used: The Iris dataset, a famous built-in dataset from scikit-learn, was chosen for simplicity and clarity. It contains 150 flower samples of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Implementation Process
1.	Importing Libraries:
I started by importing all the required Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn’s DecisionTreeClassifier.
2.	Loading the Dataset:
I used the built-in Iris dataset from sklearn. It was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis. The first few rows of the dataset were checked using head() to understand the structure.
3.	Data Preprocessing:
The features (X) and labels (y) were separated. The dataset was then split into training and testing subsets using the train_test_split() function (80% training and 20% testing).
4.	Building the Decision Tree Model:
A DecisionTreeClassifier was initialized with parameters such as criterion='entropy' to use information gain for splitting. The model was trained using the training data.
5.	Model Prediction and Evaluation:
The trained model was used to predict labels on the test data. Performance metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix were calculated to evaluate how well the model performed.
6.	Visualization:
To make the model easier to interpret, I used plot_tree() from sklearn to visualize the full Decision Tree. This visualization helps understand how the model splits the dataset based on feature importance and decision thresholds. I also plotted a heatmap of the confusion matrix using seaborn for better clarity.
7.	Saving Output:
The results, accuracy score, and visual plots were saved into the project folder. The decision tree visualization can be exported as a .png image or .txt file if needed.

Results and Analysis
The Decision Tree achieved a very high accuracy score on the Iris dataset (usually between 93–98%). The visualization clearly showed how the model made splits based on the most significant features — mainly petal length and petal width. This indicates that these features are the most important in distinguishing between Iris species.
The confusion matrix showed that the model correctly classified almost all samples, with very few or no misclassifications. This confirms that the Decision Tree was well-trained and effective on this dataset.

Applications
Decision Tree models like the one built in this task are widely used in various real-world domains such as:
•	Agriculture: Predicting crop type or yield based on soil and weather features
•	Healthcare: Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms and patient data
•	Banking and Finance: Credit risk analysis or loan approval prediction
•	Education: Predicting student performance based on grades and attendance
•	Business & Marketing: Customer segmentation and product recommendation

Conclusion
Through this task, I learned how to build, train, visualize, and analyze a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn. The process strengthened my understanding of supervised learning, feature importance, and decision boundaries. Using VS Code as the programming environment made it easy to run, debug, and visualize results effectively.
Overall, this task enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization — forming a strong foundation for future machine learning and data science projects.
